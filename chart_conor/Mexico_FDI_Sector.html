<p> The graphic points to a few interesting trends: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is a notable absence of investments in energy. This is the year before energy markets were privatised and opened up to foreign investors and the last year of available data on FDI.</li>
			<li>While manufacturing continues to serve as the largest sector receiving FDI, other sectors are growing.</li>
				<div class="blankline_small"><br></br></div>
			<li>By pursuing privitization reforms, Mexico expanded which sectors received FDI inflows.</li>
		</ul>
	<div class="box_c"><h6><em>As FDI grew in Mexico, so did</em></h6>
					   <h6><em>the variety of sectors that received investment.</em></h6></div>
