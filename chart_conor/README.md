treebranch for mexico
I got my data from OECD's stats page http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=FDI_FLOW_INDUSTRY#
Here you can select data specifically on Mexico. I then took the data only for the header categories (the ones in caps) for the year 2012 and converted this data to a json file for javascript to read.
